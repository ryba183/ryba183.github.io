							<h2>Cloud Microphysics</h2>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Cloud microphysics is a field that studies the processes occurring within clouds, particularly the formation and evolution of cloud droplets. Warm rain creation is a key aspect of cloud microphysics, where droplets grow through collision and coalescence to form precipitation without the involvement of ice particles.

								However, a challenge in warm rain formation is the size gap problem. It refers to the difficulty of explaining the rapid growth of tiny cloud droplets into raindrops through collision alone, as the efficiency of collisions decreases with increasing droplet sizes.
								Simulating the collision between cloud droplets is a complex task due to various factors involved. It requires considering droplet properties such as size, velocity, and concentration, as well as environmental factors like turbulence and electric charges. Achieving accurate modeling and simulation of the collision process is challenging due to factors such as droplet concentration, size distribution, and ambient conditions.</p>

								<!-- Understanding cloud microphysics and the challenges in simulating cloud droplet collisions contributes to improving our knowledge of precipitation formation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling. Ongoing research aims to develop advanced techniques and refine existing models to gain insights into the complexities of cloud microphysics and enhance our understanding and prediction of precipitation processes.</p> -->

					<h2>Modeling Collision-Coalescence in Particle Microphysics</h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A fundamental component of the Super-Droplet Method is the All Or Nothing (AON) algorithm, which governs the behavior of SDs following collisions between two SDs. The AON algorithm ensures mass conservation during these collision events. Let's consider two SDs, SD₁ and SD₂, with respective properties of radius (r₁ and r₂) and multiplicity (ζ₁ and ζ₂). When ζ₁ exceeds ζ₂, the post-collision properties of SD₁ and SD₂ can be described as follows: ζ₁ decreases by ζ₂, while r₁ remains unchanged. In the case of SD₂, ζ₂ remains unchanged, but r₂ increases in accordance with mass conservation. To calculate the resulting radius, we sum up the cubed radii of r₁ and r₂ and then take the cubic root.</p>

						In my research, I conducted sensitivity tests on the All Or Nothing algorithm within the context of Cumulus Congestus Cloud, drawing from the Lasher-Trap et al. (2005) setup. Specifically, I investigated the influence of the number of SDs per grid box, SD initialization method, and coalescence substep on the behavior of the AON algorithm. Additionally, to further advance my research, I explored the behavior of the AON algorithm under varying precipitation conditions, including scenarios with minimal rainfall ('LR'), moderate rainfall ('MR'), and heavy precipitation ('HR'). In these simulations, the velocity field remains consistent across all scenarios, with differences only in the microphysics aspects of the simulations.</p>

							<h2>Connection with the High Performance Computing</h2>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Using the UWLCM for research requires significant computational power, typically in the form of heterogeneous clusters consisting of CPUs and GPUs. These resources are essential for handling the complex calculations and simulations involved in weather and climate modeling.

								Throughout my research, I had the opportunity to utilize various computing resources to support my work. I made use of the resources provided by <a href="https://kdm.icm.edu.pl/" target="_blank">ICM</a> (Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling) at the University of Warsaw. 
								Additionally, I benefited from the computational capabilities offered by <a href="https://www.cyfronet.pl/en/4421,main.html" target="_blank">Cyfronet</a>, the Academic Computer Centre located in Poland. Their resources greatly contributed to the successful execution of my simulations and data analysis.
								Furthermore, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Hyogo Supercomputer Center, located at the University of Hyogo in Japan. During my 2.5-month internship, I had the privilege of utilizing their high-performance computing facilities to conduct advanced calculations and simulations.
								Throughout my internship, I extensively worked with the <a href="https://scale.riken.jp/" target="_blank">https://scale.riken.jp/>SCALE-SDM</a> (Scalable Computing for Advanced Library and Environment for Simulation and Data-driven Decision Making) model developed by RIKEN.
								Lastly, I had the privilege of exploring the capabilities of the Fugaku supercomputer, developed by RIKEN and located in Japan. The cutting-edge technology offered by Fugaku allowed me to push the boundaries of my research and obtain valuable insights.
								
								Below, you can find a glimpse of some of the noteworthy results obtained through my research efforts. These findings highlight the impact and potential of utilizing powerful computing resources in advancing our understanding of weather and climate phenomena.</p>
